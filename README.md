# CafÃ© Digital System (OOP Project)

This project was developed as part of my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course at **FAST-NUCES Islamabad**. It digitizes the cafÃ©'s operations, enabling efficient stock management and order handling using C++.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Admin Features:**
  - Manage stock (add, remove, search, and update items).
  - Generate low-stock alerts and notifications.
  - Handle employee credentials and respond to complaints.
  - View bestseller employees and high/low-sold items.

- **Employee Features:**
  - Take and manage orders from customers.
  - Process digital transactions.

- **Customer Features:**
  - Search and order food via the system.
  - Submit complaints and schedule orders.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Key Concepts:** OOP (classes, inheritance, polymorphism), file handling, sorting and searching algorithms.
